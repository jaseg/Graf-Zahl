 * Call modification in case of character differences
    * skip call if character difference is too large
    * call twice if characters are too similar
    * call random stuff with bangs on the end on args and result if characters are do disjunct
        * Array.shuffle!
    * swap arguments under certain conditions
    * return one of the argument under other conditions
    * randomize fixnums
    * garble strings
 * Addition of special handling of "evil" characters
    * making it more easy for stuff to turn evil
    * making evil stuff messing shit up
    * making evil stuff able to infect others with its evilness
    * providing a way to "exorcise" evil characters by sacrificing a good character
 * Improve performance
    * I think, unfortunately, by design this will be pretty much impossible.
